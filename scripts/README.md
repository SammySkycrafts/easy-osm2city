# User scripts

**Note**: User scripts are not part of the easy-osm2city concept... use only if your know what you are doing.

* `split-world.py`: Splits the world into 10 by 10 degrees areas covering everything from 80 north to 80 south and the poles.
* `osmium-config`: Config files for osmium, used by the split-world script.
* `worldbuild.py`: Runs the worldbuild.
